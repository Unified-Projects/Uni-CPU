2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-54#1 Critical Warning
Scoped false path, clock group or max delay datapath only constraint between clocks  
A scoped False Path timing constraint is set between clocks CPU_gmii_to_rgmii_0_0_rgmii_tx_clk and gmii_clk_125m_out (see constraint position 28 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). It is not recommended to define such scoped constraints between clocks as the constraint impacts timing paths outside of the scope.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-54#2 Critical Warning
Scoped false path, clock group or max delay datapath only constraint between clocks  
A scoped False Path timing constraint is set between clocks CPU_gmii_to_rgmii_0_0_rgmii_tx_clk and gmii_clk_125m_out (see constraint position 29 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). It is not recommended to define such scoped constraints between clocks as the constraint impacts timing paths outside of the scope.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-54#3 Critical Warning
Scoped false path, clock group or max delay datapath only constraint between clocks  
A scoped False Path timing constraint is set between clocks CPU_gmii_to_rgmii_0_0_rgmii_tx_clk and gmii_clk_125m_out (see constraint position 30 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). It is not recommended to define such scoped constraints between clocks as the constraint impacts timing paths outside of the scope.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-54#4 Critical Warning
Scoped false path, clock group or max delay datapath only constraint between clocks  
A scoped False Path timing constraint is set between clocks CPU_gmii_to_rgmii_0_0_rgmii_tx_clk and gmii_clk_125m_out (see constraint position 31 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE).

CKBF-1#1 Warning
connects_I_driver_BUFR  
The BUFGCTRL cell CPU_i/gmii_to_rgmii_0/U0/i_gmii_to_rgmii_block/i_bufgmux_gmii_clk_25m_2_5m I0 pin is driven by a BUFR cell CPU_i/gmii_to_rgmii_0/U0/i_CPU_gmii_to_rgmii_0_0_clocking/clk10_div_buf. For 7-Series devices, this is not a recommended clock topology. Please analyze your clock network and remove the BUFR to BUFGCTRL cascade.
Related violations: <none>

HPDR-1#1 Warning
Port pin direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) led direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (led) connected to this Port, but both were not found.
Related violations: <none>

HPDR-2#1 Warning
Port pin INOUT inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) CPU_i/led direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (led_OBUF) connected to this hierarchical pin/port, but both were not found.
